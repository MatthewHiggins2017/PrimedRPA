This parameters file will guide the PrimedRPA-based primer and probe design process. Please follow the instructions outlined below:

----####----
Important Note - Do not remove any of the “>” and write your input directly after this symbol.
----####----


Please define the reference name for this PrimedRPA run:
>Run_One

Please enter the path (from your current working directory) to the input fasta file:
>Input.fasta

Please classify the contents of the input fasta file as one of the following options: [SS, MS, AMS]. Whereby:
 SS = Single sequence
 MS = Multiple unaligned sequences
 MAS = Multiple aligned sequences

>MS

If multiple sequences are present in the input fasta file (Classification of MS or MAS), please indicate below the percentage homology required for the primers and probes target binding sites:
>99

Desired primer length (TwistDx specify that the ideal RPA primers are between 30 to 35 nucleotides long):
>40

Please state if you require a probe to be designed and if so what type [No,Exo,Nfo]
>Exo

Desired probe length (TwistDx specify that the ideal RPA probe is between 46 to 52 nucleotides long):
>55

Below please define your desired amplicon length. The shorter the fragment, the faster the amplification. (TwistDx recommend an amplicon length between 200bp - 500bp):
>200

Below please state the repeat nucleotide cut-off in bp (e.g. 6bp will exclude sequences containing GGGGGG).

>5

Below please insert the minimum GC percentage content for the primers and probe:
>30

Below please insert the maximum GC percentage content for the primers and probe:
>70

Below please indicate the percentage match tolerance for primer-probe dimerisation:
>33

Below please indicate percentage match tolerance for primer / probe secondary structure formation:
>25

Please enter [yes/no] below to identify if you want to perform a background DNA binding check:
>yes

Below please insert the percentage background binding threshold:
>20

Please define the path to the background fasta file which contains all the relevant background sequences which you want to screen your primers against.
>./Validation/Validation_1_Background.fasta

Please define the maximum number of primer binding sites to assess (This upper threshold is set to reduce computational demands):
>100000

Please state the primer sets per allocated per filtering tranche (This threshold is set to optimise computational efficiency):
>50000
